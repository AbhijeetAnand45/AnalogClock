# AnalogClock


- Time is precious in our life, so just to remind people that even we can create a watch for you by using our tech skill , I have made an Real-time Analog Clock which will fetch the time everysecond and will display you live.

- An analog clock is a tool for reading the time of day. The shortest hand indicates the `hour`, a longer hand indicates the `minutes`, and the longest arm indicates the `seconds`.

- `JavaScript` is used to calculate the `degree of rotations` of each hand.

# live Demo 

- To visualize the time you can click here : [My Clock](https://abhijeetanand45.github.io/AnalogClock/)


# UI Design

# Technology Used

- Complete UI is designed with the help of `HTML` and `CSS` codes.

- Functionality of Rotation of Hands is coded using `Vanilla JavaScript`.

# Hope you will feel good by watching time in my clock...üòä‚ù§
